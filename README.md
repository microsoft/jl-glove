## Direct intended uses
JL-Glove is shared for research purposes only, namely, benchmarking and inference on downstream
tasks. It is not meant to be used for clinical practice. JL-Glove was not extensively tested for
its capabilities and properties, including its accuracy and reliability in application settings,
fairness across different demographics and uses, and security and privacy.

## Out-of-scope uses
This is a research model which should not be used in any real clinical or production scenario.

## Risks and limitations
JL-GloVe TCR embeddings reflect the co-occurrence statistics of the data used for training.
